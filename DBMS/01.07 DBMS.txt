DATA ABSTRACTION IN DBMS
*database system is made-up of complex data structures. (Algorithms)
*to ease the user interaction with data base, the developers hide internal irrelevant details from users.
*This process of hiding irrelevant details (complexity) from user is called data abstraction.

TYPES OF DATA INDEPENDENCE
*physical data independence
--physical independence is ability to modify the physical schema without requiring any change in logical (Conceptual) schema and application programs.

*Logical data independence 
-- Logical data independence is ability to modify the conceptual schema without requiring any change in application programs.

TYPES OF DATABASE USERS
*Naive users (End users)
--Unsophisticated users who have zero knowledge of database system

*Application programmers 
--people who develop software using tools such as JAVA .net PHP etc.

*sophisticated Users
--Interact with database systems without using any application. they use query tools like SQL

*Specialised users (DBA)
--user write specialized database applications program
--he controls the Entire Database

Schema - is a database for user

ROLES OF DBA
*schema definition
--DBA defines logical schema of the database.eg creating database tables indexes etc
--altering the database

*Storage structure and access method definition
--DBA decides how the data is to be represented in database & how to access it.

*Defining security and integrity constraints
--DBA decides on various security and integrity constraints.

*Granting of Authorisation for Data access
--DBA determines which user needs access to which part of the database.
*Liaison with users
--DBA provide necessary data to the user.

*assisting application programmer
--DBA provides assistance to application programmers to develop application programs

*Monitoring Performance 
--DBA ensures that better performance in maintained by making change in the physical and logical schema

*Backup and recovery
--Backing up the database and recovery the systems in case of failures.

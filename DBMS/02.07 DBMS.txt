DATA BASE ARCITECTURE

structure of DBMS
*query processor
--The query processor receives the queries (requests) from the user and interprets them in form of instructions.

*DML compiler
--It converts the DML (Data manipulation Language) instructions into machine language (low level language)
adding records , updating , deleting records.

*DDL interpreter
--It interprets the DDL (data definition language) instructions and stores the record in a data dictionary (in a table containing meta-data)
--eg create table , view , indexes and other objects.
--ordering table , view , indexes and other object structures.

*Query optimiser
--It executes the DML instructions and picks the lowest cost evaluation plan out of all the alternatives present.

*Storage manager
--Storage manager acts as the interface between the data stored in the database and the queries received from the end-user.
a) Authorisation and Integrity manager : It checks the author of various users who access data and the integrity constrains of the database.
b) Transaction manager : its job is to assure to the system remains in proper state during the transaction process .

What is DATABASE ?
A database is collection of data files , indexes ,compiled DMLs and data dictionary.

What is Model?
A Model is a blueprint. it resembles the real world entity

Database Models
*Hierarchical databases -
--Represents data as hierarchical tree
--very efficient model in case of searching.
-- but had issues when a data element is associated with more than one group.
--Records for parent-child Relationships

*Network Model 
--this overcomes hierarchical model issue
--this represents data as record types
--each record has a link field corresponding to every relationship which it participates (circular linked list)
--It's a general and powerful ssf\model 
--but still it had system complexity and very less structural data independence
--records have multiple parent.

*Relational model - by Dr. EF Codd.
--Network model is replaced with relational model 
--Represents data as record types in table format.
--Relationship between records are maintained using logical data.
--Eliminates Parent child relationships , tables are used

What's relation ?
when the attributes have a single UID for tuples.
when a table has a primary key column which uniquely identifies a record in a table is known as relation.

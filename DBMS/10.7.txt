Types of Keys

*Primary key
--It is the first key used to identify one and only one instance on an entity uniquely
--PK is meant for searching records.

*Candidate key
--A candidate key is an attribute or set of attribute that can uniquely identify a tuple
--except for the primary key, the remaining attributes that can uniquely identify a tuple.
--the candidate keys are as strong as the primary key 
--Employee_ID

*Super key
--A super key is an attribute set that can uniquely identify a tuple.
--A super key is a superset of candidate key
--A super key is a set of one of more columns or attributes

*Foreign key
--Foreign key is used to make a relationship between two or more tables
--Foreign key are the column of the table used to point to the primary key of another table.

*Alternate key
--these attributes or the combinations of the attributes are called candidate keys. One key is chosen as the [primary key from these candidate keys , and the remaining candidate key , if it exists , is termed the alternate key.
--the alternate key may or may not exist. if there is only one candidate key in a relation, it does not have an alternate key.

*Composite key
--whenever a primary key consists of more than one attribute , it is known as a composite key
--this key is also known as concatenated key

*Artificial key
--the are generated by database system
--the key using arbitrary assigned data are known as artificial keys.
--these keys are created when a primary key is large and complex and has no relationship with many other relations.
--the data values of the artificial keys are usually numbered in a serial order
--Example  Row_Id

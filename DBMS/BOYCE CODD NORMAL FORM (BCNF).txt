BOYCE CODD NORMAL FORM (BCNF)
What is BCF in DBMS?
BCNF ( boyce codd normal form) is a an advanced version of the third normal form (3NF) , and often it is also known as the 3.5 Normal Form. 3NF doesn’t remove 100% redundancy in the cases where for a functional dependency (say A -> B), A is not the candidate key of the table. To deal with such situations, BCNF was introduced.
Relation R with three columns: Id, Subject and Professor. We have to find the highest normalization form, and also, if it is not in BCNF, we have to decompose it to satisfy the condition of BCNF.
ID                                    Subject                                   Professor

101                                 c++                                          KARTIK
102                                Java                                          HITESH
103                                c#                                            SARTHAK
104                                Java                                         DHRUV

NOTE:
Each professor teaches only one subject,  but one subject may be taught by multiple professors.
Subject is always dependent on the professor ( professor -> subject ).
Professor column is a non – prime attribute, while the subject is a prime attribute. This is not allowed in BCNF in DBMS.
We will decompose the table into two tabled: the Student Table and the Professor table to satisfy the conditions of BCNF
S_ID	PROFESSOR
101	MAYANK
101	KARTIK
101	HITESH
102	SARTHAK
103	DHRUV
Professor table:-
professor	Subject
Mayank	Java
Kartik	C++
Hi ctesh	Java
sarthak	C#
Professor is now the primary key and the prime attribute column, deriving the subject column. Hence , it is in BCNF.
